        "The sample had always failed to execute on any protected environment, leading us to think that there are some anti-debug and anti-sandbox techniques being used.",
        "Only later we discovered that 2 libraries were missing from the sample and some methods were incomplete, causing the immediate crash of the sample.",
        "All communications are TLS encrypted, and can’t be distinguished from normal Discord traffic.",
        "Besides all the traffic being encrypted, using Discord as a C2 also enables quick setup of new / free infrastructure, i.e the threat actor can create a new server per campaign, and host any files needed for the malware using Discords CDN (Content Delivery Network), all without spending any money.",
        "One downside to using Discord as C2 is the need to use a token, which, if extracted from the malware, can be used to take over any server where the Discord bot resides.",
        "This can be somewhat mitigated by encrypting the token, and only decrypting it with a key that is obtained during runtime.",
        "We believe that HERA (one of the missing libraries), was used to operate on encrypted data without the necessity of decrypting it, avoiding to leak the server’s token to any analysts who are analysing the sample.",
        "And here’s an example on what the traffic might look when executing those commands: 4055 89.255880 162.159.128.233 → 10.0.1.100 TCP 60 443 → 49936 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=65535 Len=0 MSS=1323 SACK_PERM=1 WS=1024 Frame 4114: 86 bytes on wire (688 bits), 86 bytes captured (688 bits) on interface \\Device\\NPF_{AD113A7F-A91D-4FCF-A6D1-8EBC7C550753}, id 0 Ethernet II, Src: c6:a9:94:52:c5:ce (c6:a9:94:52:c5:ce), Dst: de:4e:fa:d6:f0 (de:4e:fa:d6:f0) Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: 162.159.128.233, Dst: 10.0.1.100 Transmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 443, Dst Port: 49936, Seq: 6650, Ack: 1675, Len: 32 [2 Reassembled TCP Segments (1355 bytes): #4111(1323), #4114(32)] Transport Layer Security",
        "In order to execute a command on a given machine, the attacker needs to know its hardware ID (GUID) : GetFile, GetDirectory, GetDirectoryRecursive, GetDeviceTree, Shell, ReportBack, Ransom, RansomDecrypt",
        "Upon execution, the sample tries to extract information from the following applications: Steam, Chromium (multiple variants), Discord",
        "The sample will try to find the token in Discord’s log files and tries to validate it through Discord’s API (https[:]//discord.com/api/v8/users/@me).",
        "And extract any useful information it has, including the victim’s MFA code.",
        "Finally, before sending the token back to the C2, it will try to validate it through Discord’s API.",
        "The following method will read any session Steam files to obtain the username, installed apps,\r\ncookies and password if it has been saved.",
        "The sample will also try to use any Steam related cookies it might have obtained, to send a GET request to Steam, in an attempt to validate the cookies it has gotten.",
        "If successful, it will send back the cookie, email associated with that account, username, and balance in Steam wallet.",
        "Like a lot of other “stealers”, this malware will try to extract the following data from Chromium DB: Cookies, Credit cards, Logins",
        "The way it does this, is simply by running SQL queries on the Chromium DB.: SELECT host_key, name, path, expires_utc, is_secure, encrypted_value FROM cookies, SELECT name_on_card, expiration_month, expiration_year, card_number_encrypted FROM credit_cards",
        "The main way of exfiltration for the malware is through Discord, here it will send the result of all commands.",
        "All connections are TLS encrypted, and they blend in with all the other traffic, nothing in the traffic indicates it is a bot communicating with Discord.",
        "However, when exfiltrating files, the malware opts to use AnonFile (an anonymous file hosting service), where it will upload the files, and send the URL back to the Discord C2.",
        "The malware seems to have been compiled without the correct libraries, specifically it seems to be missing the Discord.NET and HERA library.",
        "While we tried different available Discord.NET available projects on GitHub, none of them seemed to be working and match the methods used by the sample, letting us believe that the author might have added custom code.",
        "The malware uses standard 128 AES to encrypt files, with a random IV, which the malware appends to the start of the file.",
        "If no masterkey is supplied, it will choose a random 16 byte key, and proceed with encryption.",
        "For the decryption part, it will replace the extension it appends when encrypting (“.abenc”).",
        "After that, it will read the first 16 bytes of the file (the IV needed), then decrypt the file using the masterkey supplied as an argument."
